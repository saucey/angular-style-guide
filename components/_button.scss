// Added by Rocco: @Jorg please check it out. i'm concerning about responsive
// approach and Leon complaining about different style and alignment approach in
// cross-browsers (take a look on firefox for example).
// So, you can also use your approach if current lhfs design has somethig else, 
// but do it in your file and class .lhfs_widget.
// But like this is not ok for UI components that are already decided fro ma 
// long time, as well in prodution. We cannot do this different style, for 
// border-radius as an exmaple.
// 
// Below you can see approach that overwrite some of your styles.

// JÃ¶rg: oK, my five cents on this: please check with BI and design before going on about
// how I don't know to make stuff responsive; it is a BI and design decision to not allow
// buttons that have over one line of text, period. The behaviour in FF was a bug, as
// I am sure happens to the best of us, and I would have liked your input on how to fix it
// instead of a lecture on how I don't have a bloody idea of what I am doing. That is
// exactly the style of cooperation I am taking offense with. People are sometimes doing
// things for reasons and not because they don't know better. Berating and lecturing them
// without making even the slightest attempt to understand those reasons is _very_
// unprofessional and arrogant, pressupposing you know everything better than everybody
// else.
// TODO: Also, writing comments like this in code is what I am usually taking offense with,
// so I will delete this once we get the discussion started.
